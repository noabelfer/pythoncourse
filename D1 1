Write a function that receives a directory path, searches there for csv files, and if csv files exist - return the following data for each: filename, amount of columns, amount of rows. You can assume that all the csv files are in the correct format.
Make sure you handle properly a case in which the provided path does not exist. In addition, you should take into account that there can be inner folders with files and you should find them all. Test your code with this folder.
Hint: check out os.walk function to iterate directory.
