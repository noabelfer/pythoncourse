Tutorial: birthday dictionary
Write a program that has 2 modes: insert mode and lookup mode.
The program asks the user whether he wants to insert a birthday date or to look up a birthday. If the user chooses to insert 
a new date, ask for the person's name and then ask for the person's birthday, and store them.
If the user chooses lookup mode, ask for a name and return the birthday of the person.
The interaction should look similar to this:



Add the following logic to the birthday tutorial:
Perform a check for the command user enters. If the input is not one of: "insert", "lookup", "quit", display relevant message and 
go back to the main menu. In addition, write a program that will be case-insensitive to commands.

When in insert mode, check whether the provided name already exists, and if so ask whether to overwrite. If yes, overwrite, 
otherwise go back to main menu.

When looking up existing names, allow users to provide only part of the name. 
Check whether there is a match to this partial name in your dictionary, and if yes, 
ask the user whether this is the name he looks for (one by one if multiple names are found). 
For example, if you have in your dictionary birthdays for "Donald Trump'' and "Melania Trump", 
and the user is in lookup mode inserted: "Trump", the interaction should be something like:
