In this exercise you are going to implement a class that will manage a RavKav card.

Use private attributes and/or methods when needed.

In this exercise we are going to use a simple version of RavKav.
Using the RavKav, one can only purchase single rides for the balance (no daily/ monthly passes or other options).
There are 3 types of rides:
•	short (up to 15 km) - 5.5 shekels
•	medium (up to 40 km) - 12 shekels
•	long (above 40 km) - 23 shekels

RavKav should store the following data:
•	holder_id
•	holder_name
•	balance
•	rides_log - all the rides represented by ride type and datetime

RavKav should support the following methods:


•	topup - given amount of money, add it to the balance
•	ride - given amount of km and datetime, purchase the ride and log it. Make sure to indicate If there is not enough money for the ride
•	get_current_balance
•	get_rides_by_date - given a date, return amount of rides in this date
•	get_rides_by_type - given a ride type (short/medium/long), return amount of  rides of this type
